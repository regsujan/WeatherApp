# Weather App

Hello from YouTube! If you're wanting to launch this app and do some testing, or whatever else, here is how you do it:

1. Manually download this repo onto your device, OR use git clone. 'git clone https://github.com/AustinDavisTech/WeatherApp.git'.
2. Once you have the app on your computer, you'll need npm to install the packages. Make sure your terminal is looking in the root directory of the project. 'npm install' will install all the depencies in package.json.
3. 'npm run dev' will launch the app and generate you a link.

Note: You will not be able to pull weather data with MY API key. I have deactivated it for security reasons. Replace MY key in the code with your own, and it should work properly! 

Warning: This site does not have fully coded responsive design. Some CSS is hardcoded to look great on my screen, but may not look as intended on your screen. Some CSS changes may be needed.
